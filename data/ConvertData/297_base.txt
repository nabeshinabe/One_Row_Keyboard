japan buys some 95,000 tonnes soybeans from china japanese importers bought some 95,000 tonnes of chinese soybeans late last month for may to september shipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sources said. the fob premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs from the premium for the november to april shipment, but down from 13.80 for the last may to september shipment. flat prices for chinese beans are based on futures prices in chicago plus the fob premium. japanese purchases of chinese soybeans, including spot buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986 crop for november to april 1987 shipment, down from some 300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said. domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the sources said. in recent years japanese importers have overbought chinese edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers, but low 1986 u.s. crop prices have discouraged the purchase of chinese origin beans for crushing, they said.
