saudi riyal deposit rates remain firm saudi riyal interbank deposits were steady at yesterday's higher levels in a quiet market. traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions amidst uncertainty over whether opec will succeed in halting the current decline in oil prices. oil industry sources said yesterday several gulf arab producers had had difficulty selling oil at official opec prices but kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency meeting of the 13-member organisation. a traditional sunday lull in trading due to the european weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity. spot-next and one-week rates were put at 6-1/4, 5-3/4 pct after quotes ranging between seven, six yesterday. one, three, and six-month deposits were quoted unchanged at 6-5/8, 3/8, 7-1/8, 6-7/8 and 7-3/8, 1/8 pct respectively. the spot riyal was quietly firmer at 3.7495/98 to the dollar after quotes of 3.7500/03 yesterday.
