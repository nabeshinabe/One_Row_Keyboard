coffee quota talks continue, no accord seen likely the international coffee organization (ico ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued with an extended session lasting late into sunday night, but delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and consumers were diminishing by the minute. the special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in coffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without agreement, delegates said. the council is expected to agree to reconvene either within the next six weeks or in september, they said. the talks foundered on sunday afternoon when it became apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the formula for calculating any future quota system, delegates said. coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought which cut brazil's crop by nearly two-thirds. brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter.
